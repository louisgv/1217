				Player initially draw a "hero card" that will represent them in the game. They then proceed to play with the NPC.
			</p>

			<p>
				The game has 3 rounds, each round has 2 phases: <a href="#Prepare"><b>prepare</b></a> and <a href="#Combat"><b>combat</b></a>. Winner are determined by the score accumulated in the combat phase. Winner of 2 rounds wins the game.
			</p>

			<p>
				The game board are split along the x axis, half for player and half for the NPC player. Each half board are then split into 3 rows.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Status: Showing the current elemental points accumulated (accept for ETHER), and the avatar.
				</li>
				<li>
					Equipment: Showing what card the player has played.
				</li>

			<h2>
				Choosing an avatar
			</h2>
			<hr/>
			<p>
				There are 5 unique avatars, each represents an alchemy element (Ether, Water, Fire, Aero, Earth). By choosing an avatar, the player is applying a higher probability of drawing cards of the same element in the prepare phase.
			</p>

			<p>
				The chosen card will also determine whether if they would be the first to make a move or not in the <a href="#Prepare">prepare phase</a>. In short, it is a 5-ways rock-paper-scisor with the NPC's randomly chosen avatar. The player won if their element beats the NPC's element according to the
				<a href="#Hierarchy">Hierarchy of Element</a>, or if it is a draw.
			</p>

				In this phase, each side (player and NPC) take turn either:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Drawing a card from the central deck
				</li>
				<li>
					Playing a card from their hand
				</li>
			</ul>

				In this phase, each side reveal their card, and the game will calculate who has the higher score by a process called <a href="#Nullification">"Nullification"</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				After the nullification, whoever has the higher combined score win the round and earn a medal. The next round will commence upon which both player will go back to the <a href="#Prepare">prepare phase</a>. The elemental points will keep add-on to what they already accumulated on the previous round.

				Nullification
			</h2>
			<hr/>
			<p>
				Nullification is a sequence of point calculation consisting of 3 steps:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<strong> Ether Cancelation: </strong> Both side's ETHER point will be subtracted by the amount of Ether from the side with fewer Ether.
				</li>
				<li>
				 	<strong> Ether Nullification: </strong> The remaining ETHER point will be used to subtract from the element with the highest point on the opposite side.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong> Element Nullification: </strong> Based on the <a href="#NullTable">Nullification Table</a>, both side's elemental point will be subtracted by the amount of the more powerful element point from the other side.
				</li>
